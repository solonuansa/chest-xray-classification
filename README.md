## Project Description

This repository contains our submission for the **SRIFOTON Machine Learning Competition 2025** organized by Sriwijaya University. The competition aims to develop accurate Machine Learning models to predict and detect respiratory diseases through chest X-ray images of patients. Participants are permitted to use various methods, tools, libraries, or frameworks.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify and detect respiratory diseases from chest X-ray images. By analyzing medical imaging data through computer vision and deep learning techniques, we seek to identify patterns and features that indicate various respiratory conditions. This application has potential value in:

- Supporting radiologists in disease detection and diagnosis
- Providing automated preliminary screening capabilities
- Improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical efficiency
- Contributing to medical imaging research and clinical decision support
